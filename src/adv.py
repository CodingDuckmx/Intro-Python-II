#
# Main
#

# Make a new player object that is currently in the 'outside' room.

# Write a loop that:
#
# * Prints the current room name
# * Prints the current description (the textwrap module might be useful here).
# * Waits for user input and decides what to do.
#
# If the user enters a cardinal direction, attempt to move to the room there.
# Print an error message if the movement isn't allowed.
#
# If the user enters "q", quit the game.

''' Understand - Plan - Execute - Reflect

Questions:

How the end user will interact with the game?
Can the user go back?
Does the game finish when you approach the Chamber?
Are there doors and do the user need items to open doors?
What (other) items the user will found?


Plan:

Starts in the Outside. You can only move north
